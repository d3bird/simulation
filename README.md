# simulation
I am planning to turn this into a city simulation.
I am currently working on this in my free time.

# organization 
The different folders show the stages of the current code.
Working is the code that has been tested.
graphics is were I am devoloping the graphics for the simulation.
workInProgressis were I am currently testing and coding.
unused is code that I created and tested that is not currently implemented in the simulation.
to compile the code, open the folder in command line run "make all" or just "make".
this will run the current stable verson of the code.

# graphics
I plan to incorporate 2d to 3d graphics as I get better at coding in openGL.
As of right now the code will run in a console and is lacking graphical support.
I will update the make file to include graphical support as I code it.
The 


# Makefile comands

"all"			- Compiles the latest stable version and runs the program.

"build"			- Compiles the latest stable version of the program .

"experimental"	- Compiles and runs the expermental code.

"graphicsTest"	- Compiles ans runs the graphical test code.

"debug"			- Compiles the expermental code with the debug console enables.

"doc"			- Generates documentation of the project using doxygen.

"clean"			- Removes the generated .o and documentation files.


# future plans
I plan to turn this into a AI testing ground to see if I can get a AI
to run a small government.

I also plan for events to happen at random times.

I also plan to incorporate graphics at some point.

There will also be a selection of different governments and differnt laws that can be passed.
